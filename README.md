Generate JDBC/DAO/Hibernate classes and configuration files from a db description.

It also generate sample mains with working code.

I know, but I need it as soon as possible and I really don't care so much about Java coding stiles. 

Anyway, it works.

The project shoud be openend and runned into Eclipse. The configuration is done editing the src/tables.txt file (is intuitive) and the Main class.

The only thing you have to do is configure properly the src/config.json file.
